wave experiments in PFT flume

Please see the doc file for the physical configurations.  

Each dorectory contains the 6 txt files, including the original and filtered wave elevations at three wave gauges.  
The original data contains two column, one for time (sampling rate = 60 Hz) and the other one is wave elevation.  
The filtered data contains one column, only the wave elevation.  
The unit is cm.
